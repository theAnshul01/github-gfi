## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you agree to keep interactions respectful and constructive. Harassment, discrimination, or abusive behavior of any kind will not be tolerated. Please be kind — we were all beginners once.

---

## Project Overview

**github-gfi** is a GitHub Good First Issues explorer built with:

- **React** + **Vite** — frontend framework and build tool
- **TypeScript** — strict typing throughout
- **Radix UI Themes** + **Tailwind CSS** — UI components and styling
- **Supabase** — authentication and bookmark storage
- **React Router** — client-side routing for multiple pages
- **GitHub REST API** — data source (via `src/services/githubService.ts`)

The goal is to make it easy for developers — especially newcomers to open source — to find beginner-friendly issues across GitHub, bookmark them, and track progress.

---

## How to Contribute

There are many ways to help, regardless of your experience level:

- Fix bugs or UI issues
- Improve mobile responsiveness
- Add new features (see [open issues](https://github.com/theAnshul01/github-gfi/issues))
- Write or improve tests
- Improve documentation or the README
- Refactor components for readability and maintainability

---

## Good First Issues

Looking for a place to start? Here are well-scoped tasks that are great for first-time contributors:

### 🐛 Fixes & Refactors

| Task | Description | Skill Level |
|---|---|---|
| **Mobile responsiveness** | The Navbar, filters, and cards break on small screens. Use Tailwind's `sm:` / `md:` breakpoints to fix them. | Beginner |
| **Improve error handling UI** | Show a user-friendly error message when the GitHub API fails or rate-limits the request. | Beginner–Intermediate |
| **Add empty state UI** | Show a helpful message and illustration when no issues match the search/filter. | Beginner |

### ✨ Enhancements

| Task | Description | Skill Level |
|---|---|---|
| **Sort options** | Add a sort dropdown (Newest, Most commented, Recently updated). | Intermediate |
| **Additional filters** | Add filters for labels (e.g. `help wanted`) or minimum repo stars. | Intermediate |
| **Shareable URL state** | Sync all filters (search, language, page) to URL query params so results are shareable. | Intermediate |
| **Add unit tests** | Set up Vitest + React Testing Library and add tests for `LanguageSelect`, `Pagination`, and `githubService`. | Intermediate |
| **Add GitHub Actions CI** | Add a workflow that runs `tsc`, `eslint`, and tests on every pull request. | Intermediate |
| **PWA support** | Add a `vite-plugin-pwa` manifest so the app is installable on mobile. | Advanced |

---

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** v20 or later
- **npm** (comes with Node)
- A [Supabase project](https://supabase.com) for local development (optional for basic features)
- A [GitHub personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) is optional but recommended to avoid hitting API rate limits during development.

### Steps

```bash
# 1. Fork the repo on GitHub, then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/github-gfi.git
cd github-gfi

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Start the development server
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

### Other Useful Commands

```bash
# Type-check the project
npm run build

# Lint the codebase
npm run lint
```

```

**Key conventions to follow:**

- All API calls go in `src/services/` — never fetch directly inside a component.
- All reusable UI pieces go in `src/components/`.
- All custom hooks go in `src/hooks/`.
- All TypeScript types go in `src/types/`.
- Use React Router for new pages in `src/pages/`.

---

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- Use strict types — avoid `any`.
- Define types/interfaces in `src/types/` and import them where needed.
- Use `interface` for object shapes and `type` for unions or aliases.

### React

- Use functional components with hooks only — no class components.
- Keep components focused: one responsibility per component.
- Avoid putting data fetching logic directly in JSX — use the `githubService` or a custom hook instead.

### Radix UI + Tailwind CSS

- Use Radix UI primitives for complex components (selects, dialogs, etc.).
- Use Tailwind utility classes for all styling.
- Use responsive prefixes (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`) — **do not write custom CSS for layout**.
- Avoid arbitrary values (`w-[347px]`) unless absolutely necessary.

### General

- Keep functions small and well-named.
- Prefer descriptive variable names over short ones.
- No commented-out code in pull requests.
- Make sure `npm run build` completes without errors before submitting.

## Submitting a Pull Request

1. **Create a branch** from `main` with a descriptive name:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b fix/mobile-navbar
   # or
   git checkout -b feat/github-token-input
   ```

2. **Make your changes**, following the coding standards above.

3. **Verify your work:**
   ```bash
   npm run build   # must pass with no errors
   npm run lint   # must pass with no errors
   ```

4. **Commit** with a clear, concise message:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "fix: make Navbar and filters responsive on mobile"
   ```
   We loosely follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):  
   `fix:` for bug fixes, `feat:` for new features, `refactor:` for restructuring, `docs:` for documentation.

5. **Push** and open a Pull Request against the `main` branch:
   ```bash
   git push origin fix/mobile-navbar
   ```

6. In your PR description, include:
   - What the change does and why
   - Screenshots or a screen recording for any UI changes
   - A reference to the related issue (e.g. `Closes #12`)

A maintainer will review your PR and may leave feedback. Please respond to review comments and push updates as needed — don't open a new PR for the same fix.
